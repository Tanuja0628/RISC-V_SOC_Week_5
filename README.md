# RISC-V_SOC_Week_5
Installation of OpenROAD and introduction to floorplanning

# Week 5 â€“ OpenROAD Flow Setup and Floorplan + Placement

## Objective
The objective of this task is to set up the OpenROAD Flow Scripts environment and execute the **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages of the physical design flow. This task bridges the gap between transistor-level design (Week 4) and backend physical implementation.

## Importance
- Understand how logical designs are physically realized on silicon.
- Learn to apply design constraints before routing.
- Understand how standard cells are arranged to minimize delay, area, and congestion.
- Observe how physical design choices affect timing and manufacturability.
  
## Steps to Install OpenROAD and Run GUI

1. Clone the OpenROAD Repository

```bash

git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts

```

2. Run the Setup Script

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

3. Build OpenROAD
   
```bash
./build_openroad.sh --local
```

![build](snapshots/build_complete.jpg)

4. Verify Installation

```bash
source ./env.sh
yosys -help  
openroad -help
```
![yosys](snapshots/yosys-help.jpg)
![openroad](snapshots/openroad-help.jpg)

5. Run the OpenROAD Flow
   
```bash
cd flow
make
```
![flow](snapshots/flow.jpg)

6. Launch the graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the final layout

```bash
 make gui_final
```

# Floorplanning and Placement in OpenROAD
Tried Floorplanning and placement for Gcd file in ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow

```bash
make DESIGN=gcd FLOW_STEPS=floorplan,placement
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/nangate45/gcd/base
openroad
```
```openroad
openroad> read_db 2_1_floorplan.odb
write_def 2_1_floorplan.def
exit
openroad> read_db 3_5_place_dp.odb
write_def 3_5_place_dp.def
exit
```
```bash
openroad -gui
```
